# StaticMethods
Write a class named StaticMethods with the following four static methods

A method called area that takes a double as a parameter and returns a double that is the area of a circle with that radius.
A method called coneVolume that takes two double parameters, the height of the cone and the radius of the base. The method should return the volume of the circular cone as a double (1/3 area of base * height - beware the 1/3).
A method that takes a double as a parameter that represents temperature in Fahrenheit and returns a double that represents the temperature in Celsius.
A method that takes an int as a parameter and returns the int with the digits in reverse order. [Hint: use / and % together]

Write a runner to demonstrate each method.
